* This Forge Mod belongs to Infinity Studios (Superproinf) and should not exist on Forge Page or any sites, the downloads are only downloadable from Github Release Channel.

## Good Question
You might be asking why i don't  use Oraxen instead, because I don't know how to use Oraxen (Paid Version), so i changed my mind and make myself a Forge Mod instead, much easier.

Another question, what Server Software I am using?
* Arclight 1.18.2 Latest
* Arclight automatically register Force Blocks or Item or Entites to PaperAPI, which is nice and just some error because something are Anti-Cheated.
